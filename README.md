This proyect was only built to showcase [this](https://github.com/lucadard/ecommerce-coderhouse_server) backend service. You can test it [here](https://ecommerce-coderhouse-frontend.vercel.app/).

## Tools I used:
Created with [vite](https://vitejs.dev/), some of the tools I used to develop this page are:
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- React Router 6

Along custom methods to communicate with my API making use of `async/await` and `React Context` and `Local Storage` to manage sessions.
